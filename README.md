# SwiftShop
- The goal of this project is to recreate a full stack Amazon-esque e-commerce website. Potentially adding in an admin dashboard as well. The strategy will be to make the front end using React first, since this will take the longest to hammer out. Then create the backend utilizing Node.js and MongoDB Atlas.
